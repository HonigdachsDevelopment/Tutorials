# ABOUT AJAX

Web browsers have a build in tool called XMLHttpRequest. XML is a data format which has been 
used in earlier days but been replaced by JSON. The tool XMLHttpRequest will 
establish the connection to the url of the page where the data we want to access for us 
and enables us to send and receive data
